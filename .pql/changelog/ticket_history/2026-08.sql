Mechanism. `internal/config/discover.go` `walkUp()` accepts a marker only when
`os.Stat` reports a **directory** (`info.IsDir()`). In a linked git worktree `.git`
is a **file** holding a `gitdir:` pointer, so the `.git` pass skips the worktree
root and keeps ascending.

Reproduced in this repo on 2026-08-07 (probe worktrees since removed):

- Worktree at `<repo>/.worktrees/probe` — `pql doctor` reports
  `vault.path=/var/mnt/data/projects/pql`, `discovered_via=".git/ ancestor at
  /var/mnt/data/projects/pql"`, and `decisions list` returns main''s 39 records.
- Worktree outside the main checkout (`/tmp/.../wt`) — no marker matches at all;
  `discovered_via="cwd fallback"`. A second, different wrong answer.

Consequence from the field: `decisions validate` returns ok:true against main''s
unchanged markdown while the edits sit in the worktree (a false positive), and
`decisions sync` parses main''s DQR and rewrites main''s pql.db plus the tracked
`governance/README.md`, ignoring the worktree entirely. `--db <worktree>/.pql/pql.db`
alone does not rescue it; only `--vault` redirects both the parse side and the
vault-derived DB coherently.

Fix.

1. Treat a `.git` **file** as a repo marker. The vault root is the directory
   *containing* it — the worktree checkout — so the `gitdir:` pointer never needs
   to be followed.
2. Marker ordering is load-bearing and is not covered by (1) alone. `walkUp` runs
   two full ascents: `.obsidian` first, then `.git`. For a worktree nested under a
   vault whose root has `.obsidian`, the `.obsidian` pass still resolves to the main
   checkout before the `.git` pass ever runs. Replace the two passes with a single
   ascent that checks both markers at each level, first hit wins. Without this the
   fix only covers non-Obsidian repos (which is why settled-reach hit it and a
   vault-shaped repo would stay broken).
3. Consider a stderr warning from the mutating verbs (`decisions sync`, `plan
   rebuild`/`import`) when the resolved vault root is not the cwd''s own worktree
   root. FR-4''s "bonus" ask for doctor visibility is already satisfied — `pql doctor`
   leads with `vault.path` + `discovered_via`.

Acceptance: unit tests in `internal/config` for (a) a `.git` file marker, (b) a
worktree nested under an `.obsidian` vault root, (c) a worktree outside the main

asserting it sees the worktree''s markdown.', NULL, '2026-08-07 12:58:10', '2026-08-07 12:58:10.361', '2026-08-07 12:58:10.361', NULL, 'c00d04b480dee72e90a44678e2d80619', 2) ON CONFLICT(hash) DO NOTHING;

Half of this already shipped. 1.10.4 (commit 8d5a53b) moved write timestamps to
millisecond precision (`strftime(''%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%f'',''now'')`), so newly written
same-second mutations no longer tie on `updated_at`.

What remains. Rows written *before* that release keep second granularity forever,
and the LWW guard in `internal/planning/changelog/exporter.go` still breaks an exact
`updated_at` tie on `excluded.hash > <table>.hash` — an ordering that is arbitrary
with respect to causality. Every replay (`plan rebuild`, fresh clone,
post-checkout/post-rewrite hooks) can therefore still revert a legacy row to an
earlier state. Measured in this repo on 2026-08-07: 113 second-granularity
timestamps vs 9 millisecond ones under `.pql/changelog/tickets/`. The settled-reach
T-1057 description is still lost on every rebuild today for exactly this reason —
the write-side fix does not reach back.

Fix (FR-3''s proposal). Tie-break equal `updated_at` by **changelog position**
rather than content hash: append order within a month file is already a total order
and it matches causality, so it repairs historical rows without rewriting them.
Alternative: a monotonic per-mutation sequence column on changelog rows — a schema
change plus a `canonical_version` bump, to be weighed against D-19''s
no-migration-runner stance. Keep the hash comparison only as the final
deterministic fallback.

Acceptance: replaying a month file whose two rows share `updated_at` yields the
later-appended row regardless of hash order; regression test in the T-1057 shape

FR-3 went undetected for a month because a rebuild silently changed a row''s
contents — the live DB served a placeholder description while the real text
survived only as a changelog row.

Add `pql plan rebuild --verify`: snapshot row counts and per-row hashes before the
drop-and-replay, compare after, and report rows whose content changed or
disappeared. Emit a specific stderr diagnostic for the dangerous shape — an equal

created a 19-ticket tree implementing a freshly written D-record and omitted

Today `decision_ref` is create-time-or-never. `internal/cli/ticket.go` wires
`--decision` only onto `ticket new`; `repo.UpdateTicketFields`
(`internal/planning/repo/tickets.go:1049`) covers title/description/priority/type
only, and `refine write` decodes with `DisallowUnknownFields`, so a
`{"decision":"D-1"}` patch is rejected outright.

Every other structural attribute is repairable after the fact — `setparent` for
hierarchy, `block`/`unblock` for dependencies, `assign`, `team`, `label`, `status`,
even `relabel` for a colliding id. Decision linkage is the only one where a
delegation mistake is permanent, and it degrades D-20''s implementation-status view
(`decisions show <id> --with-tickets`) silently: that view is only as complete as
the links happen to be.

Ask — a dedicated subcommand matching the setparent/team/assign precedent:

    pql ticket decision T-1211 D-258        # set/replace
    pql ticket decision T-1211 none         # clear, mirroring `setparent … none`

Accept comma-batched ids (`T-1,T-2,T-3`) the way `setparent` does; the motivating
case is 19 tickets at once, and a repair verb that only takes one id at a time
invites the same delegation failure it exists to fix.

Scope: repo method, a `ticket_history` row per change, changelog write-through,
integration test, the embedded skill''s ticket-subcommand table
(`internal/skill/SKILL.md`), and CHANGELOG. Decide explicitly whether to validate
that the D-record exists: `ticket new` does not today (it stores the ref
unchecked), so warn-but-write matches existing behaviour while a hard reject is a
behaviour change worth stating in the record. Adding `decision` to `refine write`''s
writable set would serve equally well; the dedicated subcommand just matches the

on natural exit"). No surface ranks tickets by overlap with a body of text.

Measured gap (2026-06-17, clide vault):

- Corpus gap — every `pql search` result is a vault `.md` path. `search` reads
  `index.db` (414 KB of vault notes); tickets live in `pql.db` (2.6 MB), which
  `search` never opens. The ticket-coverage question is invisible to it.
- A specific finding query returned `[]`.
- No lexical signal participates in rank: `pql search "terminal"` scored its top
  hits almost entirely on recency (weight 0.25), with `link_overlap`, `tag_overlap`,
  `path_proximity` and `centrality` all 0.

precisely because the pipeline, signal framework, and eval harness already exist and
are simply not pointed at the planning dataset.

reached for `pql ticket show <id> --fields id,status,title` and got exit 64,
`unknown flag: --fields`.

D-27 scoped `--fields` / `--oneline` to the *list* verbs on purpose: the problem
it solved was list dumps blowing tool-output budgets, and `show` is the
record-level surface that returns whole records by design
(`docs/output-contract.md:71` states this). The reasoning is sound, but the
surface is not guessable: an agent that has just learned `--fields` on `list`
has no way to know it stops there, and the failure costs a round trip plus a
retry every time.

Two ways out, and the second is the one asked for:

1. Sharpen the docs — say explicitly in the embedded skill that `--fields` and
   `--oneline` are list-verb flags, and that `show` always returns whole
   records.
2. Add `--fields` to `ticket show` and `decisions show`. Cheap, removes the
   footgun rather than documenting it, and keeps one projection vocabulary
   across the planning surface. `render.Project` already exists from T-56, so
   this is wiring plus tests, not new machinery.

Do both: the flag, and a skill line that states the projection vocabulary is
uniform across list and show.

Open questions for the implementer:

- `show` has shapes `list` does not: `--with-context`, `--with-blockers`,
  `--with-children`, `--tree` all attach nested join-trees. Decide whether
  `--fields` projects only the top-level record (simplest, and probably right)
  or recurses into the attached trees. State the choice in the help text.
- Comma-batched `show T-1,T-2` returns an array of show-trees; projection has
  to apply per element.

  left describing a list-only flag.', NULL, '2026-08-07 13:35:32', '2026-08-07 13:35:32.727', '2026-08-07 13:35:32.727', NULL, 'd6cf03991ad740bb9543d7c70f632b44', 2) ON CONFLICT(hash) DO NOTHING;

Trigger revision (2026-08-07): run the upgrade on pull, driven by a version change, rather than on every load. The post-merge hook already owns the replication lifecycle (D-18) and already runs plan import, so a pull is where a working-tree change to tracked files is expected and unsurprising; rewriting .pql/changelog during an arbitrary read command would surprise the user and can race an open editor. Detection therefore compares the changelog''s declared format version against the binary''s on the hook path, not on every invocation, which also removes the requirement that the check be cheap enough to run constantly. Two gaps to cover so the trigger is not only a pull: a binary can be upgraded without any pull, and a fresh clone has no merge to hook. So also check at plan import and plan rebuild, which is where a format-incompatible changelog would otherwise fail, and provide an explicit verb for the manual case.

symptoms and turn out to be the same machine pointed at two axes.

- **T-44** — forward migrations for the **pql.db schema** axis. Gated by D-19 on
  third-party distribution: an external user cannot be told to `rm pql.db` on
  every schema change, and their database may hold state no shared changelog has.
- **T-68** — forward migrations for the **changelog file format** axis. Forced
  early by T-59: the LWW guard is literal SQL inside already-committed changelog
  lines, so the fix does not reach existing repos until those files are rewritten.

What they share, and what should therefore be built once:

- An ordered list of forward-only steps, each with an id, a detector and a
  transformation — a new format or schema change becomes a new entry, not a new
  mechanism.
- A declared version per axis to compare a repo''s state against what the binary
  emits, with all declared versions living in `project.yaml` beside
  `schema_version` and surfaced through `pql version --build-info`.
- A trigger policy: on pull via the post-merge hook, plus the paths where an
  incompatible artefact would otherwise fail (`plan import`, `plan rebuild`), plus
  an explicit verb for the manual case.
- A loud diagnostic naming what was found and what was expected whenever a
  mismatch is detected and no upgrade has run. Never a silent proceed.
- A mapping of app version to each axis version, kept somewhere durable so an
  upgrade spanning several releases can be reasoned about after the fact.

Sequencing: T-68 goes first because it is forced now, and it establishes the
runner. T-44 then applies the same runner to the pql.db axis when its
distribution gate is actually reached — which keeps faith with D-19''s "no
migration framework before then" while not building the thing twice. The
counter-argument is worth stating: D-19 resists a migration runner precisely
because pql.db is regenerable, and the changelog axis is not the same kind of
artefact. If the two axes turn out to need genuinely different guarantees, split
them back apart deliberately rather than by drift.

Both axes want a decision record. The existing D-19 covers the pql.db stance;
whether this epic amends it or adds a companion record is the first thing to
settle.', NULL, '2026-08-07 14:36:09', '2026-08-07 14:36:09.505', '2026-08-07 14:36:09.505', NULL, 'b75bf3183772a810477d3d26c19d336b', 2) ON CONFLICT(hash) DO NOTHING;
