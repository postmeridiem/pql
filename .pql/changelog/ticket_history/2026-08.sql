Mechanism. `internal/config/discover.go` `walkUp()` accepts a marker only when
`os.Stat` reports a **directory** (`info.IsDir()`). In a linked git worktree `.git`
is a **file** holding a `gitdir:` pointer, so the `.git` pass skips the worktree
root and keeps ascending.

Reproduced in this repo on 2026-08-07 (probe worktrees since removed):

- Worktree at `<repo>/.worktrees/probe` — `pql doctor` reports
  `vault.path=/var/mnt/data/projects/pql`, `discovered_via=".git/ ancestor at
  /var/mnt/data/projects/pql"`, and `decisions list` returns main''s 39 records.
- Worktree outside the main checkout (`/tmp/.../wt`) — no marker matches at all;
  `discovered_via="cwd fallback"`. A second, different wrong answer.

Consequence from the field: `decisions validate` returns ok:true against main''s
unchanged markdown while the edits sit in the worktree (a false positive), and
`decisions sync` parses main''s DQR and rewrites main''s pql.db plus the tracked
`governance/README.md`, ignoring the worktree entirely. `--db <worktree>/.pql/pql.db`
alone does not rescue it; only `--vault` redirects both the parse side and the
vault-derived DB coherently.

Fix.

1. Treat a `.git` **file** as a repo marker. The vault root is the directory
   *containing* it — the worktree checkout — so the `gitdir:` pointer never needs
   to be followed.
2. Marker ordering is load-bearing and is not covered by (1) alone. `walkUp` runs
   two full ascents: `.obsidian` first, then `.git`. For a worktree nested under a
   vault whose root has `.obsidian`, the `.obsidian` pass still resolves to the main
   checkout before the `.git` pass ever runs. Replace the two passes with a single
   ascent that checks both markers at each level, first hit wins. Without this the
   fix only covers non-Obsidian repos (which is why settled-reach hit it and a
   vault-shaped repo would stay broken).
3. Consider a stderr warning from the mutating verbs (`decisions sync`, `plan
   rebuild`/`import`) when the resolved vault root is not the cwd''s own worktree
   root. FR-4''s "bonus" ask for doctor visibility is already satisfied — `pql doctor`
   leads with `vault.path` + `discovered_via`.

Acceptance: unit tests in `internal/config` for (a) a `.git` file marker, (b) a
worktree nested under an `.obsidian` vault root, (c) a worktree outside the main

asserting it sees the worktree''s markdown.', NULL, '2026-08-07 12:58:10', '2026-08-07 12:58:10.361', '2026-08-07 12:58:10.361', NULL, 'c00d04b480dee72e90a44678e2d80619', 2) ON CONFLICT(hash) DO NOTHING;

Half of this already shipped. 1.10.4 (commit 8d5a53b) moved write timestamps to
millisecond precision (`strftime(''%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%f'',''now'')`), so newly written
same-second mutations no longer tie on `updated_at`.

What remains. Rows written *before* that release keep second granularity forever,
and the LWW guard in `internal/planning/changelog/exporter.go` still breaks an exact
`updated_at` tie on `excluded.hash > <table>.hash` — an ordering that is arbitrary
with respect to causality. Every replay (`plan rebuild`, fresh clone,
post-checkout/post-rewrite hooks) can therefore still revert a legacy row to an
earlier state. Measured in this repo on 2026-08-07: 113 second-granularity
timestamps vs 9 millisecond ones under `.pql/changelog/tickets/`. The settled-reach
T-1057 description is still lost on every rebuild today for exactly this reason —
the write-side fix does not reach back.

Fix (FR-3''s proposal). Tie-break equal `updated_at` by **changelog position**
rather than content hash: append order within a month file is already a total order
and it matches causality, so it repairs historical rows without rewriting them.
Alternative: a monotonic per-mutation sequence column on changelog rows — a schema
change plus a `canonical_version` bump, to be weighed against D-19''s
no-migration-runner stance. Keep the hash comparison only as the final
deterministic fallback.

Acceptance: replaying a month file whose two rows share `updated_at` yields the
later-appended row regardless of hash order; regression test in the T-1057 shape

FR-3 went undetected for a month because a rebuild silently changed a row''s
contents — the live DB served a placeholder description while the real text
survived only as a changelog row.

Add `pql plan rebuild --verify`: snapshot row counts and per-row hashes before the
drop-and-replay, compare after, and report rows whose content changed or
disappeared. Emit a specific stderr diagnostic for the dangerous shape — an equal

created a 19-ticket tree implementing a freshly written D-record and omitted

Today `decision_ref` is create-time-or-never. `internal/cli/ticket.go` wires
`--decision` only onto `ticket new`; `repo.UpdateTicketFields`
(`internal/planning/repo/tickets.go:1049`) covers title/description/priority/type
only, and `refine write` decodes with `DisallowUnknownFields`, so a
`{"decision":"D-1"}` patch is rejected outright.

Every other structural attribute is repairable after the fact — `setparent` for
hierarchy, `block`/`unblock` for dependencies, `assign`, `team`, `label`, `status`,
even `relabel` for a colliding id. Decision linkage is the only one where a
delegation mistake is permanent, and it degrades D-20''s implementation-status view
(`decisions show <id> --with-tickets`) silently: that view is only as complete as
the links happen to be.

Ask — a dedicated subcommand matching the setparent/team/assign precedent:

    pql ticket decision T-1211 D-258        # set/replace
    pql ticket decision T-1211 none         # clear, mirroring `setparent … none`

Accept comma-batched ids (`T-1,T-2,T-3`) the way `setparent` does; the motivating
case is 19 tickets at once, and a repair verb that only takes one id at a time
invites the same delegation failure it exists to fix.

Scope: repo method, a `ticket_history` row per change, changelog write-through,
integration test, the embedded skill''s ticket-subcommand table
(`internal/skill/SKILL.md`), and CHANGELOG. Decide explicitly whether to validate
that the D-record exists: `ticket new` does not today (it stores the ref
unchecked), so warn-but-write matches existing behaviour while a hard reject is a
behaviour change worth stating in the record. Adding `decision` to `refine write`''s
writable set would serve equally well; the dedicated subcommand just matches the

on natural exit"). No surface ranks tickets by overlap with a body of text.

Measured gap (2026-06-17, clide vault):

- Corpus gap — every `pql search` result is a vault `.md` path. `search` reads
  `index.db` (414 KB of vault notes); tickets live in `pql.db` (2.6 MB), which
  `search` never opens. The ticket-coverage question is invisible to it.
- A specific finding query returned `[]`.
- No lexical signal participates in rank: `pql search "terminal"` scored its top
  hits almost entirely on recency (weight 0.25), with `link_overlap`, `tag_overlap`,
  `path_proximity` and `centrality` all 0.

precisely because the pipeline, signal framework, and eval harness already exist and
are simply not pointed at the planning dataset.

reached for `pql ticket show <id> --fields id,status,title` and got exit 64,
`unknown flag: --fields`.

D-27 scoped `--fields` / `--oneline` to the *list* verbs on purpose: the problem
it solved was list dumps blowing tool-output budgets, and `show` is the
record-level surface that returns whole records by design
(`docs/output-contract.md:71` states this). The reasoning is sound, but the
surface is not guessable: an agent that has just learned `--fields` on `list`
has no way to know it stops there, and the failure costs a round trip plus a
retry every time.

Two ways out, and the second is the one asked for:

1. Sharpen the docs — say explicitly in the embedded skill that `--fields` and
   `--oneline` are list-verb flags, and that `show` always returns whole
   records.
2. Add `--fields` to `ticket show` and `decisions show`. Cheap, removes the
   footgun rather than documenting it, and keeps one projection vocabulary
   across the planning surface. `render.Project` already exists from T-56, so
   this is wiring plus tests, not new machinery.

Do both: the flag, and a skill line that states the projection vocabulary is
uniform across list and show.

Open questions for the implementer:

- `show` has shapes `list` does not: `--with-context`, `--with-blockers`,
  `--with-children`, `--tree` all attach nested join-trees. Decide whether
  `--fields` projects only the top-level record (simplest, and probably right)
  or recurses into the attached trees. State the choice in the help text.
- Comma-batched `show T-1,T-2` returns an array of show-trees; projection has
  to apply per element.
- D-27''s record should be amended to reflect the widened surface rather than
  left describing a list-only flag.', NULL, '2026-08-07 13:35:32', '2026-08-07 13:35:32.727', '2026-08-07 13:35:32.727', NULL, 'd6cf03991ad740bb9543d7c70f632b44', 2) ON CONFLICT(hash) DO NOTHING;

Version-tracking requirement (raised 2026-08-07): this introduces a fourth version axis, and they now need to be legible together. Today there is project.yaml version (the app), project.yaml schema_version (index.db), planning.CanonicalVersion (pql.db row hashing), and with this ticket a changelog format version. A consumer holding format 1 needs to know which binary emits format 2, and pql needs to answer that without the user reading source. Requirements: declare the changelog format version in project.yaml beside schema_version so all declared versions live in one file; expose it plus CanonicalVersion from pql version --build-info, which already carries schema_version, so a consumer can diff what it has against what the binary emits; and keep a mapping of app version to each schema/format version somewhere durable (a table in docs or a section in CHANGELOG) so an upgrade across several releases can be reasoned about after the fact.
