# Architecture Decisions

Core design constraints for pql.

---

### D-1: No vector retrieval
- **Date:** 2026-04-19
- **Decision:** Retrieval is built from cheap, inspectable, structured signals — textual match, structural centrality, path proximity, recency, co-occurrence. No vector index.
- **Rationale:** The available embedded options are not tier-one infrastructure; the tier-one options are not embeddable as a single static binary. Shipping vectors means shipping a second store — new consistency problem, new lifecycle, new failure mode. The class of queries where vectors beat structured retrieval is narrower than the ecosystem narrative suggests on code-and-prose repos where identifiers, paths, and structure carry most of the signal. The absence is not a gap — it is a constraint that forces the ranker to do its job properly with the signals genuinely available.
- **Cost:** Some paraphrase queries will miss. Users reach for ripgrep when they need raw text recall. The ranker is the product; weight tuning and signal coverage are first-class engineering.
- **Raised by:** Design philosophy founding decision.
- **Revisit when:** (a) a specific class of agent task is shown, with examples, to fail on structured retrieval and succeed on semantic; AND (b) a pure-Go embedded vector store reaches tier-one quality. Either alone is insufficient.

### D-2: Intent-level surface for agents, primitives as escape hatch
- **Date:** 2026-04-19
- **Decision:** Expose intent-level commands (`pql related`, `pql search`, `pql context`) as the primary surface. Each intent does internal candidate generation, ranking, and bundle assembly. The DSL and primitive subcommands are the escape hatch for exact queries. A global `--flat-search` flag reduces any intent to its primitive layer for one invocation.
- **Rationale:** Each agent tool call is a permission event (chains erode trust), a round trip (the binary's internal queries are cheaper), and a drift opportunity (composition inside the binary is deterministic). The correct shape is one tool call per intent, not N chained primitives. The intent layer must not import the CLI layer (`internal/intent/` consumer-agnostic) to keep future MCP consumers cheap.
- **Cost:** New capabilities require new intents, not new primitives. Two files per feature (core + CLI adapter). If agents reach for the escape hatch frequently, the intent surface is wrong and should be revisited — not supplemented with more primitives.
- **Raised by:** Design philosophy founding decision.

### D-3: Two SQLite stores — index.db (cache) and pql.db (state)
- **Date:** 2026-04-22
- **Decision:** `<vault>/.pql/index.db` is a pure cache — drop and rebuild on schema mismatch. `<vault>/.pql/pql.db` is user-authored state (decisions, tickets) — forward-only migrations. Both live in `<vault>/.pql/` alongside `config.yaml`. The read-only-vault fallback applies to index.db; pql.db writes to a read-only vault fail cleanly.
- **Rationale:** One store fails both tests: as a cache it's too durable, as user state it's too fragile. The CLI-today / MCPs-tomorrow split reinforces this: a query MCP needs only index.db, a planning MCP needs only pql.db. The skill install lock sits outside SQLite so the cache invariant survived; planning cannot — status transitions, ticket history, and the D-record ↔ ticket join graph are user-authored state that must survive index rebuilds.
- **Cost:** Two files to manage. pql.db must survive upgrades; uninstalling pql leaves it in place.
- **Raised by:** Planning subcommands feature design.

### D-4: Consumer-agnostic core
- **Date:** 2026-04-22
- **Decision:** `internal/intent/`, `internal/query/`, and `internal/planning/` must not import `internal/cli/`. CLI today, MCPs (plural) tomorrow. Every consumer is an adapter.
- **Rationale:** A query-surface MCP and a planning-surface MCP are different scopes, different permissions, different audiences. Coupling them to cobra blocks future consumers.
- **Cost:** CLI wiring is separate from core logic. Two files per feature (core + CLI adapter).
- **Raised by:** Architecture review during planning subcommands.

### D-5: CLI-first, not MCP
- **Date:** 2026-04-22
- **Decision:** Claude talks to pql via `Bash(pql *)`. No MCP server. The output contract (stdout JSON, stderr diagnostics, distinguished exit codes) is what makes it safe for agents.
- **Rationale:** A static binary on PATH is the lowest-friction surface for Claude Code: one allow rule in settings.json. No daemon, no network, no permission elevation.
- **Cost:** If an MCP-only integration becomes compelling later, nothing precludes adding one that shells out to the same CLI.
- **Raised by:** Project founding decision.

### D-6: In-house migration runner, not golang-migrate or goose
- **Date:** 2026-04-22
- **Decision:** pql.db migrations use a ~50-line in-house runner in `internal/planning/schema.go`. A `schema_migrations` table tracks applied versions; each migration runs in a transaction.
- **Rationale:** The migration surface is tiny (one DB, forward-only, single-user). An external dependency adds a build dep, a CLI tool, and a migration-file convention for a problem that's ~50 lines of Go. The runner uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` so it's compatible with databases created by the Python stopgap.
- **Cost:** No rollback support. If a migration is wrong, the fix is a new forward migration. Acceptable for the scale.
- **Raised by:** Resolved P-Q-3 during planning implementation.

### D-7: Text IDs as primary keys
- **Date:** 2026-04-22
- **Decision:** Decision, question, and ticket IDs are TEXT primary keys (e.g. `D-<n>`, `Q-<n>`, `T-<n>`), not auto-incrementing integers.
- **Rationale:** Easier to preserve identity across imports. No translation layer between markdown and SQLite. IDs match what humans type and what the parser extracts verbatim.
- **Cost:** Sequential ID generation requires a MAX query. Acceptable at the expected scale.
- **Raised by:** Planning schema design.

### D-8: Ticket source of truth is SQLite, not markdown
- **Date:** 2026-04-22
- **Decision:** Tickets live in pql.db only. No automatic markdown mirror. `pql ticket export` is the half-step toward a mirror when the merge-conflict story is solved.
- **Rationale:** Shipping tickets without the mirror lets us deliver the feature now. The markdown mirror (auto-writing `tickets/T-NNN.md` on mutation) requires solving concurrent-edit conflicts, which is a separate problem.
- **Cost:** Tickets are invisible to git until explicitly exported. Acceptable for single-user workflows.
- **Raised by:** Planning locked decision. See [Q-1](questions.md#q-1-markdown-mirror-for-tickets).

### D-9: One combined skill, not separate query/plan skills
- **Date:** 2026-04-22
- **Decision:** One `pql` skill with two sections (query + planning), not separate `pql-query` and `pql-plan` skills.
- **Rationale:** Every skill's metadata sits in context permanently (~100 words each). Two skills double the metadata cost for one binary. A router skill to dispatch between them is a signal the split was wrong. The skill-create guidance says "multi-action wrappers can use the domain name alone" — pql is the domain.
- **Cost:** The skill body is longer (~170 lines). Still well under the 500-line limit.
- **Raised by:** Skill design discussion.

### D-10: State machine for ticket status transitions
- **Date:** 2026-04-22
- **Status:** Superseded by [D-14](#d-14-no-status-transition-enforcement-in-pql)
- **Decision:** Ticket status follows a directed graph: backlog→ready→in_progress→review→done, with shortcuts (in_progress→done, any→cancelled) and reverse paths (done→in_progress, cancelled→backlog). Transitions outside the graph are rejected.
- **Rationale:** Prevents nonsensical jumps (backlog→done) that make ticket history meaningless. The allowed transitions match common kanban workflows.
- **Cost:** Users can't force arbitrary transitions. If a new workflow needs a different graph, the transitions map in `repo/tickets.go` is the single edit point.
- **Raised by:** Ticket subcommands implementation.

### D-11: Max-normalization per signal before weighting
- **Date:** 2026-04-22
- **Decision:** Each signal's raw scores are divided by the maximum absolute value in the candidate batch before applying weights. This puts all signals on [0, 1].
- **Rationale:** Without normalization, signals with larger raw ranges (e.g. centrality counts of 10+ vs path_proximity of 0–1) dominate the weighted sum regardless of weight tuning. Max-norm is the simplest approach that handles heterogeneous scales.
- **Cost:** Normalization is relative to the candidate batch — the same file can score differently in different queries. Acceptable because rankings are always relative.
- **Raised by:** Enrichment layer implementation.

### D-12: Clean version strings — just the number
- **Date:** 2026-04-22
- **Decision:** `pql version` outputs only the version number from `project.yaml` (e.g. `1.0.0`). No git SHA, dirty markers, or `-dev` suffixes.
- **Rationale:** Build metadata in the version string is confusing to users and creates mismatches between the installed binary and the project manifest.
- **Cost:** No way to tell which exact commit a binary was built from via `pql version` alone. `pql version --build-info` still includes the commit hash for debugging.
- **Raised by:** User feedback after clide integration.

### D-13: plan export and plan import for versioned planning snapshots
- **Date:** 2026-04-22
- **Status:** Superseded by [D-15](#d-15-replication-via-per-table-monthly-sql-changelog-files)
- **Decision:** `pql plan export` writes all planning state (decisions + tickets + refs + deps + labels + history) to a single JSON file at the vault root (default `pql-plan.json`). `pql plan import` restores from that file into pql.db. The artifact is committed to git; pql.db stays gitignored.
- **Rationale:** Planning state is valuable enough to version but SQLite files don't belong in git. A JSON export is diffable, portable, and merge-friendly. The trigger is the user's choice — pre-push hook, sprint skill, manual — pql provides the verbs, not the policy.
- **Cost:** Two representations of the same data (pql.db + export file) can drift. The export is a snapshot, not a live mirror. Users who want the export current must run `pql plan export` before committing.
- **Raised by:** Resolved [Q-8](questions.md#q-8-occasional-pqldb-backups-into-git).

### D-14: No status transition enforcement in pql
- **Date:** 2026-04-24
- **Supersedes:** [D-10](#d-10-state-machine-for-ticket-status-transitions)
- **Decision:** pql validates that the target status is a known value but does not enforce a transition graph. Any valid status can move to any other valid status. Callers (scripts, IDE plugins, agents) layer their own workflow rules on top.
- **Rationale:** pql is a local tool — the caller is better positioned to enforce workflow-specific transitions. Hardcoding a state machine in the core blocks legitimate use cases (e.g. an agent that moves backlog→done after batch processing). The audit log records every transition regardless.
- **Cost:** Nothing prevents nonsensical transitions at the pql level. Callers that need guardrails must implement them.
- **Raised by:** User feedback during planning usage.

### D-15: Replication via per-table monthly SQL changelog files
- **Date:** 2026-05-08
- **Supersedes:** [D-13](#d-13-plan-export-and-plan-import-for-versioned-planning-snapshots)
- **Decision:** Planning state is replicated through a committed directory `.pql/changelog/<table>/`, containing two file shapes that share a naming convention so lexicographic sort gives the correct replay order:
  - `0000-schema.sql`, `0001-schema-<slug>.sql`, … — schema files. The initial `0000-schema.sql` (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS) is installed by `pql init`. Later migrations land as additional numbered schema files committed when they're authored, so schema evolution travels in the changelog alongside data.
  - `<YYYY-MM>.sql` — append-only data files, one per month of activity, containing SQL upserts sorted within the file by `(updated_at, hash)`.
  Replay reads files in lexicographic order: zero-prefixed schema files first, then year-prefixed data files chronologically. `pql.db` is a derived cache, rebuilt from the changelog.
- **Rationale:** A single mutable JSON snapshot (D-13) produces guaranteed merge conflicts because git's text merger can't distinguish rows when the file changes wholesale. Per-table monthly SQL files cooperate with git's line-based merger: distinct `updated_at` values land at distinct line positions, so concurrent commits auto-merge as line additions. Per-table partitioning keeps each file strictly append-only — cross-table sort would re-segment files mid-update. Monthly buckets keep individual files bounded. Schema files in the same directory make the changelog self-describing (any SQLite tool can replay it without pql installed) and let schema migrations propagate through the same git-merge mechanism as data — the in-house migration runner (D-6) generates and tracks these files instead of carrying SQL inline in Go.
- **Cost:** On-disk format is SQLite-flavored; cross-store portability is reduced. Decisions still source from markdown, not changelog (preserves D-8). Long-lived projects accumulate monthly files; a future rollup pass may be needed at scale (deferred). Existing `pql-plan.json` artifacts must be migrated on first export against an upgraded repo.
- **Raised by:** Multi-machine merge conflict on `pql-plan.json` during clide T-91/T-92/T-93 work — see archived design at `pql-plan-replication.md` (retired in favour of these records).

### D-16: Inline LWW guards plus content hash plus canonical row columns
- **Date:** 2026-05-08
- **Decision:** Every planning row carries `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `hash` columns. `hash = H(canonical(row except hash))` — deterministic across replicas, set at write-finalisation, immutable per write. Every SQL upsert line emitted to the changelog includes an inline last-write-wins guard: `WHERE excluded.updated_at > target.updated_at OR (excluded.updated_at = target.updated_at AND excluded.hash > target.hash)`. Canonicalisation rules — column order, value formatting, NULL representation — are version-stamped (`canonical_version`) so changes are detectable.
- **Rationale:** Inline guards make every emitted line idempotent and order-free under replay — a line can be replayed any number of times against any starting state and converge to the same result. This collapses the conflict surface to git itself: any divergence between replicas resolves at the row level via the SQL guard, regardless of how the changelog files got merged. Hash earns its keep three ways: content integrity (corruption detection), sort tiebreaker for same-`updated_at` rows (deterministic across replicas), and LWW tiebreaker at the millisecond-collision boundary (unbiased — no replica systematically wins).
- **Cost:** Every table grows three columns. Canonicalisation discipline becomes load-bearing — drift across replicas (different value formatting, schema mismatches, library upgrades) breaks hash equality and replay convergence. Wall-clock skew between machines can flip LWW outcomes within the skew window; accepted as a known limitation since sub-millisecond collisions are inherently human-ambiguous and require communication, not replication, to resolve.
- **Raised by:** Replication design — the property that "every line is self-protecting" is what makes the changelog robust under concurrent edits.

### D-17: Soft deletes via deleted_at column
- **Date:** 2026-05-08
- **Decision:** Deletions in planning tables are soft. Every table has a `deleted_at` column; deleting a row sets it to a timestamp. Read queries filter `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` by default. The "stub" row remains in the database and the changelog so other replicas know the deletion is intentional rather than missing.
- **Rationale:** Without stubs, a replica that hasn't seen the deletion would recreate the row on replay (no row → INSERT). Lotus Notes solved this in 1989 with deletion stubs; the same primitive applies to git-backed replication. Hard deletes can't be expressed in an upsert-only changelog without breaking the "every line is idempotent" invariant, which D-16 depends on.
- **Cost:** Every table grows a `deleted_at` column; every read query needs the filter. Stubs accumulate indefinitely without a purge mechanism — long-running projects need a periodic GC pass. Purge mechanism, retention threshold, and how to ensure replicas converge on purge decisions are deferred to [Q-10](questions.md#q-10-soft-delete-stub-retention-and-purge).
- **Raised by:** Replication design — emerged from the need to express deletion in the changelog without breaking idempotent replay.

### D-18: Git lifecycle hook architecture for replication
- **Date:** 2026-05-08
- **Decision:** `pql init` installs four git hooks plus a `.gitattributes` rule covering the replication lifecycle:
  - `pre-commit` → `pql plan export` (silent, fast). Materialises dirty `pql.db` rows into changelog files and stages them.
  - `post-merge` → `pql plan import` (silent if quick). Replays incoming changelog lines into `pql.db` via inline-guarded upserts.
  - `post-checkout` (branch switch only, `$3 == 1`) → `pql plan rebuild` with a visible `echo "rebuilding pql database..."`. Drops planning tables and replays the changelog from scratch.
  - `post-rewrite` (rebase, amend) → `pql plan rebuild`, also visible.
  - `.gitattributes` adds `merge=union` for `.pql/changelog/*.sql` as belt-and-braces for same-line conflicts.
- **Rationale:** Hooks below the client layer catch all git operations — IDE pulls, raw CLI, GUI tools — without requiring a `pql sync` wrapper command (rejected for scope drift into git porcelain). post-checkout and post-rewrite need full rebuild because LWW-guarded replay can only INSERT/UPDATE; a row that exists on the previous branch but not the new one would linger in `pql.db` after a checkout if only an incremental import ran. Synchronous visible rebuild matches user mental model: people expect cleanup after these operations and prefer a clear cause-and-effect message over hidden lazy execution that surfaces as random slowness on a later command.
- **Cost:** Four hooks instead of one in the install footprint. Users who disable hooks (`--no-verify`, unset `core.hooksPath`) lose the guarantees and operate on stale or divergent state — accepted, same posture as the existing pre-push lint gate. Branch switches incur a synchronous rebuild (bounded by changelog size, but visible in `git checkout` latency).
- **Raised by:** Replication design — settled after iteration through `pql sync` (rejected for scope drift), lazy-on-read (rejected for hidden slowness on hot paths like clide's once-per-minute polling), and flag-then-defer rebuild (rejected for hidden process / unexpected slowness).
