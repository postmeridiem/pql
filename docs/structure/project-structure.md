# Project Structure

This document is the canonical reference for `pql`'s repository layout, build pipeline, test infrastructure, and growth model. Read alongside `design-philosophy.md` (the binding "why") and `initial-plan.md` (the original v1 plan, retained for grammar/schema/CLI specifics).

## Why this exists

`pql` is a Go CLI that indexes a repository and serves Claude Code (and humans) with structured repository context. The structure has to satisfy four constraints:

1. **Encode the design philosophy** — generate vs rank as separate phases, one SQLite store, provenance-as-data, intent-specific weighting.
2. **Reconcile two mental models.** Per the user's framing: *"feel simple as a query engine, but dynamically offer connections if they are available."* Primitives are the spine; ranker-driven **connections** are an optional enrichment layer on top, not a replacement. Every intent is a named combination of (query primitives + enrichment profile).
3. **Absorb growth** beyond the initial Claude-Code-skill use case — new intents, new signals, new extractors (code/Logseq), and eventually a second consumer (e.g. MCP server) without restructuring.
4. **Make ranking quality a first-class test concern** — "ranking is the product" per the philosophy, so regressions in ranking quality must be as visible as test failures.

## Guiding principles

- **Query-first surface, connections on request.** Direct subcommands (`pql files`, `pql tags`, `pql backlinks`, `pql query <DSL>`) feel like a query engine. A `--connect` flag (and intent-level commands that default it on) attaches related-context bundles when signals exist. No enrichment = plain rows. Enrichment = same rows + `connections` array with provenance.
- **Always an off-switch for enrichment.** A global `--flat-search` flag forces raw query results — disables `connect/` entirely, even on intent subcommands that would otherwise enrich by default. *"Sometimes you just need the exact result queried exactly where you want it to look."* The DSL path (`pql query <DSL>`) is already flat by default and doubles as the explicit "give me only what I asked for" entry point; `--flat-search` covers the cross-cutting case so any subcommand can be reduced to its primitive layer.
- **Generate wide, rank careful, return sparingly.** Architecturally separate packages; neither imports the other.
- **Provenance is data, not a cross-cutting concern.** Each signal returns its own `Contribution{Name, Raw, Normalized, Weight}`; the combiner aggregates. No central `explain.go`.
- **Consumer-agnostic core.** `internal/intent/`, `internal/query/`, and `internal/planning/` must not import `internal/cli/`. CLI today, MCPs (plural) tomorrow — a query-surface MCP and a planning-surface MCP are different scopes, different permissions, different audiences; no reason to assume one fused server. Every consumer is an adapter.
- **Two stores, two regimes.** `<vault>/.pql/index.db` is the regenerable cache — SQLite with FTS5; schema versioned; drop-and-rebuild on mismatch. `<vault>/.pql/pql.db` is user-authored state (planning, possibly other features later) — forward-only migrations, lazily created by the first writer. The split is codified in `docs/adr/0003-pql-db-for-user-state.md`.

> **Tier-2 packages.** Many of the directories above (`internal/query/…`, `internal/connect/…`, `internal/intent/…`, `internal/planning/…`, `tools/eval-report/`) are **planned**, not yet scaffolded. They land alongside their first feature so empty package directories don't sit in the tree. `internal/store/` and `internal/index/` already exist (0.1.0 shipped them); `testdata/council-snapshot/` is populated; `internal/planning/` arrives with the first decisions/ticket commit per `planning.md`.

## The query → connect → bundle pipeline

```
CLI subcommand (cli/query_*.go | cli/intent_*.go | cli/dsl.go)
   │
   ▼
query/primitives  (or  query/dsl)        ← produces typed rows
   │
   ▼                                     ← if --connect or intent requests it (and not --flat-search):
connect/{signal,rank,neighborhood,bundle}
   │
   ▼
cli/render                               ← stdout JSON; provenance inline in connections[]
```

- **Primitive path only:** rows out, no connections array, no provenance. Feels like a query engine.
- **Enriched path:** same rows, each with a `connections` array (capped depth: 1 hop default, 2 max) and per-result `signals[]` recording each `Contribution`. Intent-specific weight profiles live in `internal/intent/<name>/weights.go`.
- **DSL bypasses enrichment** by default (escape hatch = raw rows); documented in `docs/intents.md`.
- **`--flat-search` global flag** forces the primitive path on any subcommand, including intent commands that would otherwise enrich. Implementation: a single short-circuit check in `cli/` before invoking `connect/` — no per-subcommand wiring needed. Listed under global flags in `docs/output-contract.md`.

## Growth — what new work looks like

| Growth | Where it lands | Files changed |
|---|---|---|
| New intent | `internal/intent/<name>/` + `internal/cli/intent_<name>.go` | 2 new files |
| New signal | `internal/connect/signal/<name>.go` + weight entries per intent | 1 new file + N-line edits |
| New extractor | `internal/index/extractor/<name>/` + registry registration | 1 new subpackage |
| New planning verb | `internal/planning/repo/` method + `internal/cli/{decisions,ticket,plan}_<verb>.go` | 1 new CLI file + method on repo |
| New pql.db table | `internal/planning/schema.go` forward migration + repo helpers | 1 migration step + repo additions |
| New consumer (MCPs) | `cmd/pql-mcp-query/` reusing `internal/intent/`+`internal/query/`; `cmd/pql-mcp-plan/` reusing `internal/planning/` | Bounded by consumer-agnostic core discipline; query surface and planning surface can ship as separate binaries |
| Code-aware indexing | `internal/index/extractor/code/` with tree-sitter | No changes to `store/`, `connect/`, `query/`, `planning/` |

## Test infrastructure

Three tiers, idiomatic Go placement:

1. **Unit tests** — `_test.go` next to source. Includes fuzz targets for the DSL (`internal/query/dsl/lex/fuzz_test.go`, `internal/query/dsl/parse/fuzz_test.go`). Run via `make test`.
2. **Integration tests** — `internal/cli/integration_test.go` gated by `//go:build integration`. Shells the built binary against fixture vaults in `testdata/`. Validates the full output contract (stdout JSON shape, stderr JSON diagnostics, exit codes). Run via `make test-integration`.
3. **Ranking-quality eval** — `internal/connect/rank/eval_test.go` gated by `//go:build eval`. Goldens at `internal/connect/rank/testdata/golden/*.json` as `{query, intent, expected_top_k, notes}`. Computes NDCG@k / MRR / P@k, **plus per-signal contribution diffs vs. the previous run** (debuggability > metric). A standalone `cmd/pql-eval/` binary exposes the same harness for bisecting weight changes. Run via `make eval`.

Fixture vaults: `testdata/council-snapshot/` (frozen copy of `/var/mnt/data/projects/council/`), plus synthetic vaults generated by `internal/fixture/` for eval corners.

## Build & release pipeline

**Makefile targets** (see `Makefile` for the full list):

| Target | Does |
|---|---|
| `make build` | `go build -ldflags='…version…' -o bin/pql ./cmd/pql` |
| `make install` | Copy `bin/pql` to `~/.local/bin/` |
| `make test` | Unit tests, fast |
| `make test-race` | Unit tests with `-race` |
| `make test-integration` | `go test -tags=integration ./internal/cli/...` |
| `make eval` | `go test -tags=eval ./internal/connect/rank/...` |
| `make eval-baseline` | Record current eval as baseline for next diff |
| `make fuzz-dsl` | Run DSL fuzz corpus (10m default) |
| `make lint` | `golangci-lint run` |
| `make vuln` | `govulncheck ./...` |
| `make fmt` | `gofmt -w` + `goimports -w` |
| `make tidy` | `go mod tidy` |
| `make snapshot` | `goreleaser release --snapshot --clean` |
| `make profile-cpu` / `make profile-mem` | pprof against largest fixture |
| `make clean` | `rm -rf bin/ dist/` |

**CI scripts in `ci/`, GitHub Actions wrappers in `.github/workflows/`:**

The substance of CI lives in `ci/*.sh` so it can run identically locally and in CI. GitHub Actions workflows are thin shell-out wrappers; they can be replaced with another provider later if needed without touching the scripts.

- `ci/lint.sh` — `golangci-lint run`, `goreleaser check`, `govulncheck ./...`. Under 1 min.
- `ci/test.sh` — unit + `-race` + integration. Under 5 min budget on PR.
- `ci/release.sh` — on tag `v*`: GoReleaser full pipeline. 5 platforms (linux/{amd64,arm64}, darwin/{amd64,arm64}, windows/amd64), SHA256 sums, SBOM, cosign signatures, auto-generated notes. Publishes to GitHub Releases per `.goreleaser.yaml`.
- `ci/eval.sh` — scheduled job: `make eval`, post metrics. Not blocking; regressions surface as visible drift in the metrics record.

**Distribution channels:**
- GitHub Releases — primary channel, signed binaries + SHA256SUMS + SBOM.
- `go install github.com/postmeridiem/pql/cmd/pql@latest` for developers with a Go toolchain.
- `pql self-update` once v0.1 ships — hits the GitHub Releases API, downloads + replaces atomically, verifies SHA256.

## Observability and docs discipline

- **Telemetry on `--verbose`:** `internal/telemetry/` injects per-phase timings (`generate_ms`, `rank_ms`, per-signal ms) into the stderr diagnostic stream. This is how we'll tune weights honestly.
- **Schema-version negotiation:** `pql version --build-info` emits `{version, commit, date, go_version, schema_version}`. The skill checks `schema_version` against its own and refuses on mismatch with a remediation hint. Contract documented in `docs/compatibility.md`.
- **Catalog docs** sit at the top of `docs/`:
  - `docs/intents.md` — intent catalog + per-intent contract.
  - `docs/signals.md` — every signal: what it measures, where it shines, where it fails.
  - `docs/adr/` — Architecture Decision Records. First two to land: `0001-no-vectors.md`, `0002-intents-not-primitives.md`.

## Verification

End-to-end once each milestone lands:

1. `make lint` + `make test` + `make test-race` → all green.
2. `make build` → `./bin/pql --version` prints stamped build info; `./bin/pql version --build-info` prints JSON including `schema_version`.
3. `make snapshot` → `dist/` contains 5 platform archives with checksums.
4. `make test-integration` against `testdata/council-snapshot/` → exit codes 0/2/65/66 all exercised.
5. `make eval` with a seeded 3-query golden set → produces NDCG@5/MRR/P@5 report + per-signal contribution table.
6. Push a throwaway branch → `ci/lint.sh` + `ci/test.sh` complete locally under 5 min (the host pipeline shells out to these, so local-equals-CI by construction).
7. Tag a pre-release `v0.0.1-rc1` and run `ci/release.sh` (or push the tag and let `.github/workflows/release.yaml` invoke it) → produces signed binaries published to GitHub Releases; verify cosign signature locally.
8. Install binary + skill on a clean machine; run `pql files` in the Council vault → feels like a query engine. Add `--connect` → same query, now with `connections[]` and `signals[]`. Confirms the simple-but-optionally-enriched surface.
9. Run an intent command (`pql related members/vaasa/persona.md`) with and without `--flat-search`: without the flag returns enriched bundle; with the flag returns the bare query result and zero connections/provenance. Confirms the off-switch is reachable from every entry point.
